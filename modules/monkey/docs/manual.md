# Welcome to Monkey2!

Monkey2 is an open-source, user-friendly, cross-platform programming language designed primarily for game programming.

The monkey2 release includes a simple IDE coded in pure monkey2 called 'Ted2'. Ted2 is not a fully fledged IDE (yet) but is intended to provide a 'works anywhere' IDE solution for using monkey2 on any platform you can get it building on.

Monkey2 is a crowd funded project. If you like what you see, please consider contributing to development either via paypal donation or by becoming a Patreon supporter.

Have fun!
